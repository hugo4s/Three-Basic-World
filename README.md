This is a basic demonstration project of a 3D world using the Three.js library. The aim of this project is to serve as an introduction to 3D graphics development on the web, exploring concepts such as rendering, shading, lighting, and camera control.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics on the web.
- **OrbitControls**: An orbit control that allows the user to interact with the 3D scene through mouse movements.

## About the Project ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project was developed as part of a personal learning process to explore the fundamental concepts of 3D graphics on the web. Throughout development, various techniques and functionalities offered by the Three.js library were experimented with.

## Key Features ‚≠ê

- Rendering of a basic 3D scene with a plane and a cube.
- Lighting using a directional light and an ambient light.
- Shading and texturing of the cube and the plane.
- Camera control to allow navigation within the scene.
